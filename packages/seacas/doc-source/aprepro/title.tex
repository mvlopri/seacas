\aprepro{} is an algebraic preprocessor that reads a file containing both
general\textit{ }text and algebraic, string, or conditional expressions. It interprets
the expressions and outputs them to the output file along with the general text.
The syntax used in \aprepro{} is such that all expressions between the delimiters
\textbf{\{} and \textbf{\}} are evaluated and all other text is simply echoed to
the output file. \aprepro{} contains several mathematical functions,
string functions, and flow control constructs. In addition, functions
are included that implement a units conversion system. \aprepro{} was
written primarily to simplify the preparation of parameterized input
files for finite element analyses at Sandia National Laboratories;
however, it can process any text file that does not use the characters
\textbf{\{ \}}.\newpage
