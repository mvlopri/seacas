\section{Introduction}
One of the typical processes for performing parallel analyses with
\exo{} databases is to decompose the finite element model into
multiple pieces such that each processor can read and write its own
portion of the finite element model and results data.  For example, if
a parallel analysis is to be run on the mesh file \file{mesh.g} using
8 processors, then \file{mesh.g} will be decomposed into 8 pieces or submeshes:
\file{mesh.g.8.0}, \file{mesh.g.8.1}, $\ldots$,
\file{mesh.g.8.7}. Each submesh will contain a subset of the nodes and
elements of the entire mesh and some communication data indicating
which nodes and elements are on the boundary of this submesh and the
submesh of one or more other processors.

The analysis code is then executed in parallel and each processor
reads its portion of the mesh from its respective submesh; when it
outputs results and/or restart data, it creates a new file containing
its portion of the submesh and the results that are calculated on that
submesh.  An ``N'' processor run will create ``N'' separate files for
each results and/or restart ``dataset'' that it creates.

The analyst may want to visualize or postprocess the data in the
submeshes as a single mesh, so each submesh needs to be joined
together to create a single ``global'' file containing all of the
data.\footnote{Note that some visualizers can handle the separate,
per-processor files, so joining is not required in all cases.}

This joining together of parallel submeshes is the purpose of \epu{}.
It will read the data from each submesh and map it into the correct
location in the ``global'' file; discarding duplicate data as
required.

The name \epu{} is an acronym for {\em \exo{} Parallel Unification}
Program.  The ``alternate'' meaning of \epu{} is {\em E Pluribus Unum} which means
``Out of Many One'' which is described in more detail at
\url{http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/unum.html}.

\section{Invoking \epu}
\epu{} is typically invoked using a command line similar to:
\begin{syntax}
epu [options] basename
epu [options] -auto full_filename
\end{syntax}
Where \param{basename} is the ``base'' portion of the filename.  For
example, if one of the files to be joined is \file{results.e.8.3},
then the basename would be specified as \file{results}.

\subsubsection{File Naming Convention}
The naming of the per-processor files must follow the convention that
the last two dot-separated suffixes of the filename represent the
total processor count and the zero-based processor rank of the
processor that created the file, respectively.  Also, the last suffix
(rank) must be zero-filled such that the width of the field is the
same as the width required to represent the processor count.  For
example, if the files were written for a 1000 processor run, the files
would be \file{basename.e.1000.0000} through
\file{basename.e.1000.0999}.

\subsubsection{Defaults and Requirements}
The default behavior is that \epu{} will join all per-processor files
into the output file; all transient variables (global, nodal, element,
nodeset, and sideset) will be transferred for all timesteps.  It is
assumed that all per-processor files represent a portion of the same
overall finite element model and that they all have the same \exo{}
meta data including variable names.  In addition, each file must have
the same timesteps.

Several options are available to modify the default execution of
\epu{}. These are documented below.

\subsection{Options}

\subsubsection{Basic invocation options}
The majority of the time, the filename-related options to \epu{} can
be determined automatically by passing the \param{-auto} option and
instead of the basename, the full filename of one of the
files is specified. For example, given files of the form:
\file{/scratch/user/results.e.16.00},
\file{/scratch/user/results.e.16.01}, $\ldots$,
\file{/scratch/user/results.e.16.15}; \epu{} could be invoked
as:
\begin{syntax}
	epu -auto /scratch/user/results.e.16.00
\end{syntax}
and the output file would be written to \file{results.e} in the
current directory.

\subsubsection{Disk-related filename options}
If this simple invocation does not work for some reason, then the
following options can be used for full control over the reading and writing of the
files. \epu{} will read and write files of the form:
\begin{syntax}
        Reads:  root\#o/sub/basename.suf.\#p.0 to
                root(\#o+\#p)%\#r/sub/basename.isuf.\#p.\#{p-1}
        Writes: current\_directory/basename.osuf
\end{syntax}
Where:
\begin{description}
\item[current\_directory] By default, this is the directory from which
\epu{} is being run.  It can be set via the \param{-current\_directory
<val>} option.

\item[basename] The base portion of the filename before the suffices
and after the root/sub portion (if any).
\item[isuf] The suffix of the input files not including the
processor-specific data. For example, given the file
\file{results.e.8.0}, the suffix would be \param{e}.
\item[osuf] The suffix that should be used for the output file.
\item[\#p] The number of processors the files were decomposed for.
\item[root] The ``non-raid'' portion of the complete pathname (see
below).  If not on a raid system, this can be omitted.
\item[sub]  The portion of the pathname following the raid data (see
below). If not on a raid system, this can be omitted.
\item[\#o] The ``raid offset''
\item[\#r] The ``raid count'' which is the number of raid disks.
\end{description}

The raid options are not used very often, but can be very useful if
your compute system uses a filesystem that requires it.  On some
compute systems, a parallel job needs to spread its data across
multiple filesystems in order to load balance the IO requests.  The
filesystem mount points will typically look something like:
/scratch0, /scratch1, /scratch2, /scratch3.  Within these filesystems,
the directory hierarchy will typically match.  So, for example, assume
that a 16 processor job is run on a filesystem like this and the
files to be joined are named:

\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.0}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
/scratch0/user/results.e.16.00 & /scratch1/user/results.e.16.01 \\
/scratch2/user/results.e.16.02 & /scratch3/user/results.e.16.03 \\
/scratch0/user/results.e.16.04 & /scratch1/user/results.e.16.05 \\
/scratch2/user/results.e.16.06 & /scratch3/user/results.e.16.07 \\
/scratch0/user/results.e.16.08 & /scratch1/user/results.e.16.09 \\
/scratch2/user/results.e.16.10 & /scratch3/user/results.e.16.11 \\
/scratch0/user/results.e.16.12 & /scratch1/user/results.e.16.13 \\
/scratch2/user/results.e.16.14 & /scratch3/user/results.e.16.15 \\
\end{tabular}

If the user is in some other directory and wants the output file
written to /scratch0/user/results.epu, the command to do this
would be:
\begin{syntax}
	epu -extension e -output\_extension epu -raid_count 4
		-processor_count 16 -Root\_directory /scratch
		-Subdirectory user -current\_directory
		/scratch0/user  results
\end{syntax}
If for some reason, the processor 0 file had been written to the
\file{/scratch2} filesystem and then subsequent files followed the
cycle, then the additional option \param{-offset 2} specifying the
``raid offset'' would be added.

The options that control this are:
\renewcommand\arraystretch{1.5}
\begin{longtable}{lp{4.0in}}
\param{-auto} 		& Automatically set Root, Proc, Ext from the
	name of one of the files being joined.  The filename is used in place
	of ``basename''. \\
\param{-extension <val>}& \exo{} database extension for the input
files   \\
\param{-output\_extension <val>} & \exo{} database extension for the output file  \\
\param{-offset <val>} 	& Raid Offset  \\
\param{-raid\_count <val>} & Number of raids  \\
\param{-processor\_count <val>} & Number of processors  \\
\param{-current\_directory <val>} & Current directory  \\
\param{-Root\_directory <val>} & Root directory  \\
\param{-Subdirectory <val>} & Subdirectory containing input exodusII files  \\
\end{longtable}
Note that the majority of the time, this complicated option setting is
not required and everything can be set automatically via the
\param{-auto} option.

\subsubsection{Additional Options}

\begin{longtable}{lp{4.0in}}
\param{-help} 		& Print the version and a summary of all options and exit.  \\
\param{-version} 	& Print version and exit.  \\
\param{-map} 		& Map element ids to original order if possible [default].  \\
\param{-nomap} 		& Do not map element ids to original order.  \\
\param{-debug <val>} 	& Debug level (values are added together). \par
	\begin{tabular}{l@{ = }l}
		                  1 & Timing information.\\
        		          2 & Check consistent nodal field values between processors.\\
		                  4 & Verbose Element block information.\\
		                  8 & Check consistent nodal coordinates between processors.\\
        		         16 & Verbose Sideset information.\\
        		         32 & Verbose Nodeset information.\\
        		         64 & Put exodus library into verbose mode.\\
        		        128 & Check consistent global field values between processors.  \\

	\end{tabular}\\
\param{-width <val>} & Width of output screen, default = 80.  \\
\param{-add\_processor\_id} & Add 'processor\_id' element variable to
the output file. The value of the variable is the processor on which
that element existed.  \\
\param{-append} & Append to an existing database instead of overwriting an existing database.
	Timestep transfer will start after last timestep on the
	existing database.  \\

\param{-steps <val>} & Specify a subset of timesteps to transfer to output file.\par
	Format is begin:end:step. For example, -steps 1:10:2
	would result in steps 1,3,5,7,9 being transferred to the output
	database. Enter LAST to just transfer last step, for example, ``-steps LAST''  \\
\param{-Part\_count <val>} & How many pieces (files) of the model
	should be joined. This option is typically used with either
	the \param{-start\_part} or the \param{-subcycle} options in
	the case where the user wants to only join a subset of the
	individual per-processor files.\\

\param{-start\_part <val>} & Start with processor {n} file
(0-based). Used with the \param{-Part\_count} option   \\

\param{-subcycle [val]} & Subcycle. Create 'val' subparts if 'val' is specified.
                Otherwise, create multiple parts each of size 'Part\_count'.
                The subparts can then be joined by a subsequent run of \epu{}.
	This option is usually used for one of two cases:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The maximum number of simultaneously open files on the filesystem
		or system is less than the processor
		count\footnote{\epu{} will output a message to standard output if this
		happens.}.  In that case, unless this option is used, \epu{} will have to
		open and close each file for each time it is accessed
		which can take a long time.
	\item The user wants to use a parallel visualization program that can
		handle a model split into multiple parts, but wants
		fewer parts than were used in the parallel analysis run.
	\end{enumerate}
	If the parameters result in the creation of ``n'' parts, then
	the output files written will be \file{basename.osuf.n.0}
	through \file{basename.osuf.n.n-1}.\\

\param{-gvar <val>} & Comma-separated list of global variables to be
joined or ALL or NONE.  The default behavior is that all global
variables will be written to the output file.\\
\param{-evar <val>} & Comma-separated list of element variables to be joined or ALL or NONE.
                Variables can be limited to certain blocks by appending a
                colon followed by the block id.  For example,
		\param{-evar sigxx:10:20} would result in the variable
		\param{sigxx} would be written for element blocks with
		id 10 and 20. The default behavior is that all element
		variables will be written to the output file.  \\
\param{-nvar <val>} & Comma-separated list of nodal variables to be
		joined or ALL or NONE. The default behavior is that all nodal
		variables will be written to the output file. \\
\param{-nsetvar <val>} & Comma-separated list of nodeset variables to
		be joined or ALL or NONE.  The default behavior is that all nodeset
		variables will be written to the output file.\\
\param{-ssetvar <val>} & Comma-separated list of sideset variables to
		be joined or ALL or NONE.  The default behavior is that all sideset
		variables will be written to the output file.\\
\param{-omit\_nodesets} & Don't transfer nodesets to output file.  \\
\param{-omit\_sidesets} & Don't transfer sidesets to output file.  \\
\param{-copyright} & Show copyright and license data.  \\
\end{longtable}

When \epu{} is invoked, it will parse the user-specified options from
the command line and it will also see if the environment variable
\param{EPU\_OPTIONS} exists.  If the variable exists, then it will be
parsed first followed by the parsing of the options on the command line.

\section{Example}
The output below shows the results of running the following command:
\begin{syntax}
	epu -auto epu_example.rsout.8.0
\end{syntax}

The first section of the output shows the code version followed by some
information showing how the \param{-auto} option decoded the filename
and automatically set some of the filename-related options.  It then
shows which files will be used in the joining process.

\begin{verbatim}
epu --  E Pluribus Unum
	(Out of Many One -- see http://www.greatseal.com/mottoes/unum.html)
	ExodusII Parallel Unification Program
	(Version: 3.30) Modified: 2011/01/12

The following options were determined automatically:
	 basename = 'epu_example'
	-processor_count 8
	-extension rsout
	-Root_directory

Input(0): './epu_example.rsout.8.0'
...
Input(7): './epu_example.rsout.8.7'
\end{verbatim}

\sectionline
The next section shows the progress of reading the meta data
information from each file and creating the output file and populating
the mesh portion of the bulk data.

\begin{verbatim}
**** READ LOCAL (GLOBAL) INFO ****
Node map is contiguous.
Finished reading/writing Global Info


**** GET BLOCK INFORMATION (INCL. ELEMENT ATTRIBUTES) ****

**** GET COORDINATE INFO ****

\end{verbatim}

\sectionline
At this point, the non-transient portion of the output file is
complete and all that remains is defining the results data and
transferring it to the output file.  The timing information in the
timestep transfer gives an estimate of how long the transfer is
expected to take; its accuracy can vary depending on the machine load
and the file system load.

At the end, a summary of the output mesh is given.

\section{Related Codes}
\epu{} replaces the functionality of the
\code{nem\_join}~\cite{bib:nem_join} code.  \epu{} provides a superset of
the \code{nem\_join} functionality and is also much faster in almost
all cases.  \epu{} also supports nodeset and sideset variables and the
naming of element blocks, nodesets, and sidesets which are not
supported by \code{nem\_join}.
